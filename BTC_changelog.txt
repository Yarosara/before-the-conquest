V.0.1 - The Tale of the Moon King
-----------

author's note
- exalted traits are tailored for the discerning player that wants an excellent start for their games
- congenital trais (all of them) are slightly more common, including the bad ones
- congenital traits also have better chances of being inherited if both parents have them (mendelian genetics)
 > yes you can make dwarfism a Lannister family trait, just hook up Tyrion with the right girl
 > imagine all the beautiful tall children Brienne and Tormund will have
- please ignore the random summer island with a dragon egg, I'm still deciding if I should let her keep it
- also, marrying a Mormont to a Stark princess might seem pretencious at first but...
